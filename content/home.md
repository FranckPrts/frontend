Welcome to MindHive!

MINDHIVE is a web-based citizen science platform that supports real-world brain and behavior research

… for students & teachers who seek authentic STEM research experience, and
… for neuroscientists & cognitive/social psychologists who seek to address their research questions outside of the lab.

Before we get to the lessons and experiments, let’s first get you settled. We’d like to know a few things about your research interests and your current knowledge about brain and behavior research. This is not a test! We are just interested in getting to know you a bit better so that (a) we can give you the proper guidance through your mindHIVE journey, (b) we can better understand how participating in the program may affect your research attitudes, and (c) we can improve the program for future users.

Did we say “thank you” yet for being our pilot class?

**Thank you** for being our pilot class!

Now let’s get to work.

Let’s start with the most important part: pick a username and profile picture! This information will be visible to other people who visit the platform. For privacy reasons, don’t use your own name or a picture of your face. Instead, use an alias and pick an avatar. You can pick your (science) hero or come up with your own name. Feel free to discuss with your peers! [5 mins]
