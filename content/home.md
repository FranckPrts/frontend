  <h3>
    Before you begin the MINDHIVE program, we want to learn a bit
    about you!
  </h3>
</div>

<div>
  We’d like to know a few things about your research interests and your current knowledge about brain and behavior research. This is not a test! We are just interested in getting to know you a bit better so that (a) we can give you the proper guidance through your mindHIVE journey, (b) we can better understand how participating in the program may affect your attitudes towards science, and (c) we can improve the program for future users.
</div>

Now let’s get to work.
