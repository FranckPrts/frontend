          'Students learn about the ingredients of a good research question. What makes a question relevant, generalizable, and testable? Students begin by exploring how they encounter everyday questions in science, and start to develop language to describe the nature of scientific inquiries.  Using real world experience, they learn about  the ingredients of a good research question. ',
